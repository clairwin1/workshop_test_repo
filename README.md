# workshop_test_repo
My test repository for Intro to the Command Line (Wickes, E. Fall 2020).

I will be adding more to this repository as we learn about more features.

I'm struggling to hold back my fiction-writing brain.
I keep coming up with new ideas,
new plots––
it's getting harder to hold zer at bay.
